# Go CLI Todo App 📝
This is a simple command-line todo application written in Go. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks into/from a local JSON file.

## Installation 🚀
To install the application, you will need to have Go installed on your system. Once you have installed Go, you can download and install the application using the following command:

## Usage 💻
Be sure to run `gtodo init` to generate an empty JSON file in your home directory to store todo tasks.

To use the application, simply run the `gtodo` command followed by one of the following subcommands:
- `add`: Add a new task ➕
- `list`: List all tasks 📋
- `update`: Update the details of an existing task ✏️
- `delete`: Delete a task ❌

Each subcommand has its own set of options and arguments. Here are some examples of how to use the application:

```bash
# Add a new task
gtodo add -task "learn-go" -cat "code"

# List all tasks
gtodo list
gtodo list -done 1 # list tasks that are completed
gtodo list -done 1 -cat "code" # list tasks that are completed and belong to category "Project"

# Update an existing task
gtodo update -id 1 -task "learn-py"
gtodo update -id 1 -cat "ai"

# Delete a task
gtodo delete -id 1
gtodo delete -done 0
```
